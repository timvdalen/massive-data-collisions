\section{Introduction}
In the last years simulating physically-based deformable models has become a popular research topic in Computer Graphics. The deformation of a model is usually defined by some physical properties of the (simulated) modelâ€™s material, and it is computed by various numerical methods. The volumetric description of the model is given by a tetrahedral mesh. Due to the large amount of tetrahedral elements and vertices, GPUs are very useful for speeding-up all involved computations.\\
Roughly speaking there are two tasks in deformation simulation, collision detection and collision handling. We will be focusing on collision detection, which means calculating which of the tetrahedral elements collide. Simply checking each pairs in the model would be infeasible in real time. To accelerate the detection of collision pairs, a hierarchy of axis-aligned bounding boxes is used. This Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) is given by a binary tree. The leaves of the tree represent the bounding boxes of the actual geometry (triangular mesh faces), whereas nodes at different tree levels represent smallest-enclosing, axis-aligned bounding boxes of the bounding boxes of their child nodes.\\
We have been provided a simple computer program running on the CPU, which reads from disk a BVH tree (corresponding to one of several models) and allows
its visual inspection. Our task is to replace certain functionality of this program by its GPU counterpart, using CUDA.
