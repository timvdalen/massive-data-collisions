\section{Problem Description}
We have been provided a simple computer program running on the CPU, which reads from disk a BVH tree (corresponding to one of several models) and allows
its visual inspection. Our task is to replace certain functionality of this program by its GPU counterpart, using CUDA.

Our task is to replace the function \textit{breakDown} by an efficient CUDA implementation. This function transforms face-face collisions to vertex-face and edge-edge collisions, more precisely it has as input and output:\\
\\
\indent \indent \textbf{Input}\\ 
\indent \indent array of size \textit{nFaces * maxSize} in which for each face at most \textit{maxSize}\\
\indent \indent indices to potentially-colliding faces are stored.\\
\indent \indent \textbf{Output}\\
\indent \indent array \textit{potentialVertexFace} of size \textit{nVertices * maxSize}\\
\indent \indent array \textit{potentialEdgeEdge} of size \textit{nEdges * maxSize}\\
\\
Furthermore, \textit{potentialEdgeEdge} is not allowed to contain duplicate entries, in the given program this is ensured by only storing an edge at the endpoint with lowest id.
