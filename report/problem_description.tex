\section{Problem Description}
Our task is to replace the function \textit{breakDown} by an efficient CUDA implementation. This function transforms face-face collisions to vertex-face and edge-edge collisions, more precisely it has as input and output:\\
\\
\indent \indent \textbf{Input}\\ 
\indent \indent array of size \textit{nFaces * maxSize} in which for each face at most \textit{maxSize}\\
\indent \indent indices to potentially-colliding faces are stored.\\
\indent \indent \textbf{Output}\\
\indent \indent array \textit{potentialVertexFace} of size \textit{nVertices * maxSize}\\
\indent \indent array \textit{potentialEdgeEdge} of size \textit{nEdges * maxSize}\\
\\
Furthermore, \textit{potentialEdgeEdge} is not allowed to contain duplicate entries, in the given program this is ensured by only storing an edge at the endpoint with lowest id.
